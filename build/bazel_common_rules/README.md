# Bazel Common Rules

This directory contains common Bazel rules and tools shared between the Platform
and Kernel builds.

For platform-specific rules, place them in the platform checkout's
[//build/bazel/rules](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/bazel/+/master/rules/)
directory.

For kernel-specific rules, place them in kernel checkout's [//build/kleaf
directory](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/build/+/master/kleaf/).
