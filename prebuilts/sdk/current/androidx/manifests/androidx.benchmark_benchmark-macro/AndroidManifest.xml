    QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES is used to enable macrobenchmarks to read package information from
    potential target packages, e.g. for querying debuggable, profileable, or default launch intent.

    This could also be done by making each macrobenchmark specify a <queries/> tag, with the
    target package, but this removes the need for documenting that setup step, and detecting
    misconfiguration.
