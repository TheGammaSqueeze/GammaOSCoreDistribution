## Configurations files for art LUCI builders.

This directory contains art's configs for its LUCI builders.

They are generated by the [lucicfg] tool based on Starlark code.
See [main.star] for configs of production builders.

After modifying any of the files, run `./main.star` to regenerate the configs.

There are currently two helper scripts `format.sh` and `validate.sh`;
Format is akin to `go fmt` and will automatically re-format the .star files.
Validate will check to make sure the files are formatted and that their output
matches the files in the `generated` directory (there is a TODO to integrate
this with presubmit).

Currently active version can be checked at
https://luci-config.appspot.com/#/projects/art .
