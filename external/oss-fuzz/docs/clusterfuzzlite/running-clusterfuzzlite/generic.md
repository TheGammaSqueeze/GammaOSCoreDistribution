# Running ClusterFuzzLite in a Generic Environment
TODO: Rename run_cifuzz.py to run_clusterfuzzlite.py

This page describes how to run clusterfuzzlite using the run_clusterfuzzlite.py
script, a low level script that is used by CI systems to run ClusterFuzzLite.
This guide is useful if you want to run ClusterFuzzLite outside of CI or if you
want to run it on a CI system that isn't supported yet.
