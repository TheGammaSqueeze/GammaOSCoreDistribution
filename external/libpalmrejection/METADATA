description:
    "This is a fork of the Chromium code for palm rejection. The palm rejection "
    "feature processes the input event stream and determines if any of the "
    "pointers in that stream are palms. The output of this code is a list of "
    "pointers that are identified as palms. Typically, the expectation is that "
    "the upper layers would then cancel or remove these pointers from the input "
    "event stream that is sent to applications."
