Description:
Originally authored by Damon Kohler, Scripting Layer for Android, SL4A, is an
automation toolset for calling Android APIs in a platform-independent manner. It
supports both remote automation via ADB as well as execution of scripts from
on-device via a series of lightweight translation layers.

This version of sl4a is heavily modified to act as an RPC library for
third-party facades (called code snippets). It no longer has much in common with
the original sl4a project.


Local Modifications:
- LICENSE file has been created for compliance purposes. Not included in
  original distribution.
- This version of sl4a has been extensively refactored to remove all Android
  facades and scripting interpreters. Only the RPC layer and facade registration
  engine remain. This is to facilitate its use as a library in user projects.
