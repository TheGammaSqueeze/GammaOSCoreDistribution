 * [DESCRIPTION]
 *
 * This verifies Fuzzy Sync's basic ability to reproduce a particular
 * outcome to a data race when the critical sections are not aligned.
 *
 * We make the simplifying assumptions that:
 * - Each thread contains a single contiguous critical section.
 * - The threads only interact through a single variable.
 * - The various timings are constant except for variations introduced
 *   by the environment.
 *
 * If a single data race has N critical sections then we may remove
 * N-1 sections to produce a more difficult race. We may then test
 * only the more difficult race and induce from this the outcome of
 * testing the easier races.
 *
 * In real code, the threads may interact through many side
 * effects. While some of these side effects may not result in a bug,
 * they may effect the total time it takes to execute either
 * thread. This will be handled in tst_fuzzy_sync02.
 *
 * The number of variables which two threads interact through is
 * irrelevant as the combined state of two variables can be
 * represented with a single variable. We may also reduce the number
 * of states to simply those required to show the thread is inside or
 * outside of the critical section.
 *
 * There are two fundamental races which require alignment under these
 * assumptions:
 *      1        2
 * A +-----+  +----+	The outer box is total execution time.
 *   | #   |  | #  |	The '#' is the critical section.
 *
 *   |  # |   |   # |
 * B +----+   +-----+
 *
 * So we can either have the critical section of the shorter race
 * before that of the longer one. Or the critical section of the
 * longer one before the shorter.
 *
 * In reality both threads will never be the same length, but we can
 * test that anyway. We also test with both A as the shorter and B as
 * the shorter. We also vary the distance of the critical section from
 * the start or end. The delay times are cubed to ensure that a delay
 * range is required.
 *
 * When entering their critical sections, both threads increment the
 * 'c' counter variable atomically. They both also increment it when
 * leaving their critical sections. We record the value of 'c' when A
 * increments it. From the recorded values of 'c' we can deduce if the
 * critical sections overlap and their ordering.
 *
 * 	Start (cs)	| End (ct)	| Ordering
 * 	--------------------------------------------
 * 	1		| 2		| A before B
 * 	3		| 4		| B before A
 *
 * Any other combination of 'cs' and 'ct' means the critical sections
 * overlapped.
