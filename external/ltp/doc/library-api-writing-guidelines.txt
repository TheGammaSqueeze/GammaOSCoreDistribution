LTP Library API Writing Guidelines
==================================

1. General Rules
----------------

For extending library API it applies the same general rules as for writing tests,
(see https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki/Test-Writing-Guidelines[Test Writing Guidelines],
offline: 'doc/test-writing-guidelines.txt'),
with strong focus on readability and simplicity.

Library tests are in 'lib/newlib_tests' directory.

Don't forget to update docs when you change the API.

2. C API
--------

API source code is in headers `include/*.h`, `include/lapi/*.h` (backward
compatibility for old kernel and libc) and C sources in `lib/*.c`. Files have
'tst_' prefix.

3. Shell API
------------

API source code is in `tst_test.sh`, `tst_security.sh` and `tst_net.sh`
(all in 'testcases/lib' directory).

Changes in the shell API should not introduce uncommon dependencies
(use basic commands installed everywhere by default).
