Build for Android:
This tool depends on HIDRAW being compiled into the Android device's kernel. This may not be enabled by default. When developing on platforms you may need to rebuild the kernel to enable it.

Then:
Install the latest version of the Android NDK, and add it to your PATH.
Then run:
$ make android
