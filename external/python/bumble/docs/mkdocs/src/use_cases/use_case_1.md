# Bumble python application connected to a device with a "real" Bluetooth controller

Write a python application (ex: a GATT client that will connect to a hear rate sensor, or a GATT server exposing a battery level) that can connect to or receive connections from a "real" Bluetooth device (like a sensor, or a mobile phone) using a Bluetooth controller (a USB dongle, or HCI-UART controller)
