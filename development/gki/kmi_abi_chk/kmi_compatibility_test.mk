# Use the one under $(LOCAL_PATH)/sym-5.* by default for self testing.
# The reason not to use the one under kernel/prebuilts/5.* by default
# is because the KMI ABI may not be stable during development.
#
# Set CURR_5_4_SYMVERS/CURR_5_10_SYMVERS explicitly for the actual
# current kernel symbol file to be checked. E.g.,
# $ m CURR_5_10_SYMVERS=kernel/prebuilts/5.10/arm64/vmlinux.symvers \

# Previous kernel symbol files, against which the latest one is checked
# The file names of previous kernel symbol files are of this form:
#     *.symvers-$(BID)
# Here *.symvers is a symbolic link to the latest build.
