// Defines the structure of the kernel tracepoint:
//
//  /sys/kernel/tracing/events/power/gpu_work_period/
//
// Drivers must define an appropriate gpu_work_period kernel tracepoint (for
// example, using the DECLARE_EVENT_CLASS and DEFINE_EVENT macros) such that the
// arguments/fields match the fields of |GpuWorkPeriodEvent|, excluding the
// initial "common" field. Drivers must invoke the tracepoint (also referred to
// as emitting the event) as described below. Note that the description below
// assumes a single physical GPU and its driver; for devices with multiple GPUs,
// each GPU and its driver should emit events independently, using a different
// value for |gpu_id| per GPU.
//
// |GpuWorkPeriodEvent| defines a non-overlapping, non-zero period of time from
// |start_time_ns| (inclusive) until |end_time_ns| (exclusive) for a given
// |uid|, and includes details of how much work the GPU was performing for |uid|
// during the period. When GPU work for a given |uid| runs on the GPU, the
// driver must track one or more periods that cover the time where the work was
// running, and emit events soon after. The driver should try to emit the event
// for a period at most 1 second after |end_time_ns|, and must emit the event at
// most 2 seconds after |end_time_ns|. A period's duration (|end_time_ns| -
// |start_time_ns|) must be at most 1 second. Periods for different |uids| can
// overlap, but periods for the same |uid| must not overlap. The driver must
// emit events for the same |uid| in strictly increasing order of
// |start_time_ns|, such that it is guaranteed that the tracepoint call for a
// period for |uid| has returned before the tracepoint call for the next period
// for |uid| is made. Note that synchronization may be necessary if the driver
// emits events for the same |uid| from different threads/contexts. Note that
// |end_time_ns| for a period for a |uid| may equal the |start_time_ns| of the
// next period for |uid|. The driver should try to avoid emitting a large number
// of events in a short time period (e.g. 1000 events per second) for a given
// |uid|.
//
// The |total_active_duration_ns| must be set to the approximate total amount of
// time the GPU spent running work for |uid| within the period, without
// "double-counting" parallel GPU work on the same GPU for the same |uid|. Note
// that even if the parallel GPU work was submitted from several different
// processes (i.e. different PIDs) with the same UID, this overlapping work must
// not be double-counted, as it still came from a single |uid|. "GPU work"
// should correspond to the "GPU slices" shown in the AGI (Android GPU
// Inspector) tool, and so should include work such as fragment and non-fragment
// work/shaders running on the shader cores of the GPU. For example, given the
// following for a single |uid|:
//  - A period has:
//    - |start_time_ns|: 100,000,000 ns
//    - |end_time_ns|:   800,000,000 ns
//  - Some GPU vertex work (A):
//    - started at:      200,000,000 ns
//    - ended at:        400,000,000 ns
//  - Some GPU fragment work (B):
//    - started at:      300,000,000 ns
//    - ended at:        500,000,000 ns
//  - Some GPU fragment work (C):
//    - started at:      300,000,000 ns
//    - ended at:        400,000,000 ns
//  - Some GPU fragment work (D):
//    - started at:      600,000,000 ns
//    - ended at:        700,000,000 ns
//
// The |total_active_duration_ns| would be 400,000,000 ns, because GPU work for
// |uid| was executing:
//  - from 200,000,000 ns to 500,000,000 ns, giving a duration of 300,000,000 ns
//    (encompassing GPU work A, B, and C)
//  - from 600,000,000 ns to 700,000,000 ns, giving a duration of 100,000,000 ns
//    (GPU work D)
//
// Thus, the |total_active_duration_ns| is the sum of these two
// (non-overlapping) durations. Drivers may not have efficient access to the
// exact start and end times of all GPU work, as shown above, but drivers should
// try to approximate/aggregate the value of |total_active_duration_ns| as
// accurately as possible within the limitations of the hardware, without
// double-counting parallel GPU work for the same |uid|. The
// |total_active_duration_ns| value must be less than or equal to the period
// duration (|end_time_ns| - |start_time_ns|); if the aggregation approach might
// violate this requirement then the driver must clamp
// |total_active_duration_ns| to be at most the period duration.
//
// Protected mode: protected GPU work must not be reported. Periods must be
// emitted, and the |total_active_duration_ns| value set, as if the protected
// GPU work did not occur.
//
// Note that the above description allows for a certain amount of flexibility in
// how the driver tracks periods and emits the events. We list a few examples of
// how drivers might implement the above:
//
// - 1: The driver could track periods for all |uid| values at fixed intervals
//   of 1 second. Thus, every period duration would be exactly 1 second, and
//   periods from different |uid|s that overlap would have the same
//   |start_time_ns| and |end_time_ns| values.
//
// - 2: The driver could track periods with many different durations (up to 1
//   second), as needed in order to cover the GPU work for each |uid|.
//   Overlapping periods for different |uid|s may have very different durations,
//   as well as different |start_time_ns| and |end_time_ns| values.
//
// - 3: The driver could track fine-grained periods with different durations
//   that precisely cover the time where GPU work is running for each |uid|.
//   Thus, |total_active_duration_ns| would always equal the period duration.
//   For example, if a game was running at 60 frames per second, the driver
//   would most likely emit _at least_ 60 events per second (probably more, as
//   there would likely be multiple "chunks" of GPU work per frame, with gaps
//   between each chunk). However, the driver may sometimes need to resort to
//   more coarse-grained periods to avoid emitting thousands of events per
//   second for a |uid|, where |total_active_duration_ns| would then be less
//   than the period duration.
