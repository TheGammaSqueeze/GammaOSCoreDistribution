 * This interface is used by telephony and telecom to talk to cellular radio for the purpose of
 * radio configuration, and it is not associated with any specific modem or slot.
 * All the functions have minimum one parameter:
 * serial: which corresponds to serial no. of request. Serial numbers must only be memorized for the
 * duration of a method call. If clients provide colliding serials (including passing the same
 * serial to different methods), multiple responses (one for each method call) must still be served.

     * slot. PortId is the id (enumerated value) for the associated port available on the SIM. Each
     * physical slot can have multiple ports which enables multi-enabled profile(MEP). If eUICC
     * physical slot supports 2 ports, then the portId is numbered 0,1 and if eUICC2 supports 4
     * ports then the portID is numbered 0,1,2,3. Each portId is unique within a UICC physical slot

     * will only have portId 0.

     * physical slot(value 1), port (index 0), while the other physical slot remains unmapped and
     * inactive.
     * slotMap[0] = SlotPortMapping{0 //physical slot//, 0 //port//}
     * slotMap[0] = SlotPortMapping{1 //physical slot//, 0 //port//}
     *
     * Example no. of logical slots 2 and physical slots 2 supports MEP with 2 ports available:
     * Each logical slot must be mapped to a port (physical slot and port combination).
     * First logical slot (index 0) can be mapped to physical slot 1 and the second logical slot
     * can be mapped to either port from physical slot 2.
     *
     * slotMap[0] = SlotPortMapping{0, 0} and slotMap[1] = SlotPortMapping{1, 0} or
     * slotMap[0] = SlotPortMapping{0, 0} and slotMap[1] = SlotPortMapping{1, 1}
     *
     * or the other way around, the second logical slot(index 1) can be mapped to physical slot 1
     * and the first logical slot can be mapped to either port from physical slot 2.
     *
     * slotMap[1] = SlotPortMapping{0, 0} and slotMap[0] = SlotPortMapping{1, 0} or
     * slotMap[1] = SlotPortMapping{0, 0} and slotMap[0] = SlotPortMapping{1, 1}
     *
     * another possible mapping is each logical slot maps to each port of physical slot 2 and there
     * is no active logical modem mapped to physical slot 1.
     *
     * slotMap[0] = SlotPortMapping{1, 0} and slotMap[1] = SlotPortMapping{1, 1} or
