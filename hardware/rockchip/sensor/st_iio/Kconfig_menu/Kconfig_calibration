	bool "Apply factory calibration from /persist filesystem"
	default n
	help
	  SensorHAL during boot read factory calibration files from
	  /data filesystem and load calibration values.

	  This option enable also a service in order to check if new calibration
	  files are available into /persist/STSensors_calibration/ folder and copy
	  to /data filesystem.

	  This option require /persist/STSensors_calibration/ folder is
	  available and factory calibration files are available into it.

config ST_HAL_FACTORY_CALIBRATION_USING_APK
	bool "Use ST APK to calibrate sensors"
	depends on ST_HAL_FACTORY_CALIBRATION
	default n
	help
	  SensorHAL use STSensor_daemon service in order to get factory
	  calibration data from APK and store it to /persist filesystem.a

	  With this option you do not need to have /persist/STSensors_calibration/
	  folder but service will create it.

config ST_HAL_HAS_SELFTEST_FUNCTIONS
	bool "Integrate self-test functions"
	default n
