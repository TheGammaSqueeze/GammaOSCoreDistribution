These are the release notes for STMicroelectronics SensorHAL version 3.
Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all about, explain how
to install the dynamic library, and what to do if something goes wrong.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

   Compiling, configuring and running the 3.x SensorHAL requires up-to-date
   versions of various software packages.

   Installing required packages: (used during `menuconfig`)
   $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev

   HAL require two headers file from linux kernel. File can be found under
   Documentation/iio-example-3.1x.y/. Copy files to linux/iio/


LIBS
   In order to run some sensors in the application processor side, libraries
   are needed. Run auto-extract script packages in the root folder of the HAL.

STMICROELECTRONICS LIBRARIES VERSION REQUIREMENTS:
   - STAccCalibration:				v1.x
   - STMagCalibration:				v1.x
   - iNemoEngine_gbias_Estimation:		v1.x
   - iNemoEnginePRO:				v1.x
   - iNemoEngine_GeoMag_Fusion:			v1.x
   - STAccCalibration:				v1.x


INSTALLING SOURCE CODE
   Copy HAL source code into hardware/STMicroelectronics/SensorHAL_IIO folder.
   During build process Android will include automatically the Android.mk.
   In your device.mk (device/{vendor}/{board}/device.mk) adds package build
   information:

   PRODUCT_PACKAGES += sensors.{TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM}

   Note: device.mk can not read $(TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM) variable, read and
   replace the value from your BoardConfig.mk


CONFIGURING THE SENSOR HAL

--> To configure sensor the Sensor HAL IIO use mm utility from HAL root folder (only for Android version up to M included)

        $mm sensors-defconfig       (default configuration)
or

        $mm sensors-menuconfig

--> For all the Android versions:

	from <AOSP_DIR\> run the usual android build procedure:

        source build/envsetup.sh

        lunch <target version>

        make


	After the initial build of Android and SensorHAL, change directory to SensorHAL path and load initial Android settings

        "source android_data_config"

	than run make command with one of the following options:

        "make sensors-defconfig"        Set to default configuration

        "make sensors-menuconfig"       Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.

        "make sensors-cleanconf"        Delete hal_config, hal_config.old and configuration.h files.


COMPILING THE SENSOR HAL CODE

--> From SensorHAL_IIO root folder:

   "mm"			Build the code.

   "mm -B"		Force to rebuild all the code.

   "mm DEBUG=y"		Build SensorHAL in debug mode (no code optimization, generate map file).

--> From Android source code $TOP folder:
   Just build Android source code as described on source.android.com. The SensorHAL will
   be automatically build and installed into system.img
