# This dockerfile generates the build environment required to build Floss, which
# is the Linux build for the Fluoride Bluetooth stack.

# Inherit from a recent Debian version. The slim version is a smaller variant
# meant for containers.
# This digest is taken from the tag debian:bookworm-slim (if you want to update)

# At this point, the base container is ready. Now we need to build and install
# both libchrome and modp-b64. If you ran this via `docker-build-image.py`, this
# will be done after the image is created and tagged. Otherwise, you need to
# manually mount the source and run the dpkg builders in `system/build/dpkg`.
