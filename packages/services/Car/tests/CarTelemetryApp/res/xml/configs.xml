<!-- Each config is enclosed by <config> tags, a config must include "name", "version" and
"script_name" attributes. The "script_name" should correspond to a script name of a lua script in
the res/raw/ folder.

Each config must have a pair of <subscribers> tags that encloses one or more
<subscriber> tags.

Each <subscriber> must contain "handler" and "priority" attributes, where handler is the name of
the entry function in the lua script and priority is used to prioritize tasks in low system
resource environments, from 1 to 100, with 1 having most priority.

Each <subscriber> must also contain one and only one <publisher> that's the publisher the
subscriber listens to for data.

The <publisher> has a "type" attribute that denotes one of the several types of publishers
available (refer to the telemetry proto for all types). Depending on the type, the enclosed
tags will be different since each type of publisher requires different settings. The format
is simply <setting_fieldd_name>SETTING_VALUE</setting_field_name> for each of the publisher
fields (refer to telemetry proto for each type's fields). -->
