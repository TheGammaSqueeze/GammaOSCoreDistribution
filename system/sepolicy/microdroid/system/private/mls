# MLS policy constraints
#

# We aren't using MLS in Microdroid. But the policy grammar requires
# at least one MLS declaration, and checkpolicy enforces this. We
# don't want to disable MLS, since we share some file labels with the
# host (e.g. files in APEXes) which does have MLS. So we include this
# fairly harmless constraint.

# Process transition:  Require equivalence.
